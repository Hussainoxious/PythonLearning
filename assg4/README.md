Q.4) Capturing all the rules for what makes a valid email address is complex, so we will use a simplified definition of a valid email address. This definition generally works just fine for extracting email addresses from documents.

The first part of the email address is the username portion, and it must not contain whitespace or the @ symbol. The username portion is followed by the @ symbol. After the @ symbol is the domain, which does not contain any whitespace or the @ symbol. The domain contains two or more non-empty components which are separated by periods. The final component must consist of only letters from the English alphabet.

The following are valid email addresses:

nsommer@wooster.edu n.sommer@cs.wooster.edu yippee_skippy@yee-haw.wheeeee fun-times@Taylor.hall.wooster.edu

The following are not valid email addresses:

n@sommer@wooster.edu n sommer@wooster.edu nsommer@wooster..edu nsommer@wooster.edu-org
