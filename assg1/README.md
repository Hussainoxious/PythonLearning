Q1. Ask the user for their name and age, assign theses values to two variables, and then print them. (use input("") to get user information)



Q2. Format and print the information below using string interpolation:
   title = "Joker"
   director = "Todd Phillips"
   release_year = 2019
   The output should look like this:
   Joker (2019), directed by Todd Phillips



Q3. Write a program to determine whether an employee is owed any overtime. You should ask the user how many hours the employee worked this week, as well as the hourly wage for this employee.
If the employee worked more than 40 hours, you should print a message which says the employee is due some additional pay, as well as the amount due. The additional amount owed is 10% of the employees hourly wage for each hour worked over the 40 hours. In effect, the employees get paid 110% of their hourly wage for any overtime.



Q4. Swap two tuples in Python
a = (100,90)
b=(200,80)
Output should be:
a=(200,80)
b=(100,90)



Q5. Printing numbers 1 to 10 on the screen and store the result in list and exclude the value divisible by 3 output should be
[1,2,4,5,7,8,10]



Q6. Below you’ll find some code with a number of errors. Try to go through the program line by line and fix the issues in the code. I’d encourage you to try running the program while you’re working on it, as reading the error messages is great practice for debugging your own programs.
hourly_wage = input("Please enter your hourly wage: ')
prnt("Hourly wage: ")
print(hourlywage)
print("Hours worked: ")
print(hours_worked)
hours_worked = input("How many hours did you work this week? ")
