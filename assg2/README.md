Q1. Ask the user to enter a number. Tell the user whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.



Q2. Write a program to determine whether an employee is owed any overtime. You should ask the user how many hours the employee worked this week, as well as the hourly wage for this employee.
If the employee worked more than 40 hours, you should print a message which says the employee is due some additional pay, as well as the amount due.
The additional amount owed is 10% of the employees hourly wage for each hour worked over the 40 hours. In effect, the employees get paid 110% of their hourly wage for any overtime.



Q3. In a dictionary, the keys have to be unique, whereas the values can be duplicated. So, given a dictionary as shown below, how can you print all the unique values it has?
D1 = {'list1': [4, 7, 10, 20], 'list2': [7, 16, 9, 10], 'list3': [13, 10, 4, 8], 'list4': [7, 20, 6, 11]}
Output = [4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 20]



Q4. Count the Frequency of List Items Using a Dictionary
Input : List1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7] Output {1:2,2:2,3:1,4:2,5:2,6:1,7:2}
It should print no of times it has the same value eg 1 is repeating 2 times, so dictionary will have 1:2,



Q5. Write a Python program to remove an empty tuple(s) from a list of tuples.
Sample data: [(), (), ('',), ('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b', 'c'), ('d')]
Expected output: [('',), ('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b', 'c'), 'd']



Q6. Write a Python program to sort a tuple by its float element.
Sample data: [('item1', '12.20'), ('item2', '15.10'), ('item3', '24.5')]
Expected Output: [('item3', '24.5'), ('item2', '15.10'), ('item1', '12.20')]
